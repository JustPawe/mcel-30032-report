\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
As a result of modern technology, the way things are done is very different compared how it was twenty years ago. Since then everything has been speeding up, including a key area of society, namely: education. In the past fifteen to twenty years several businesses emerged to make education better and easier for both students and teachers. These businesses usually try to create software artefacts to improve some aspect of the broader field. Such software artefacts are innovative learning tools and virtual learning environments (VLEs).
